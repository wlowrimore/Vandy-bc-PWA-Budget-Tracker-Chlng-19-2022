# PWA Budget Tracker

![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-maroon)<br />

## Description

This is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that tracks a user's budget. It has offline use capabilities that will save/cache the user's budget input information, and retrieve it when internet connectivity is detected. This process is made possible by the use of a "service worker" and a local storage in an IndexedDB.

### Installation:

In your computer's terminal, first type the command `npm install`. Next, type the command `node server.js`. This application was built using MongoDB, so it will look for the Mongo database. If you do not have MongoDB installed on your machine, either install it, or adjust the server settings in the server.js file to accomodate the server you are using.
